### Setup

Add devices to setup/devices.csv, edit setup/wpa_supplicant.conf to match your wlan.

#### Server
```
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
python3 server/manage.py migrate
```

On first install login to server now, go to /MAAPS/server and run
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser 
```

to add your first user. 
Open the user admin page https://SERVERIP/webif/user/list, add firstname and lastname to admin user and save.
Open the django admin page at https://SERVERIP/admin/, open the "Tokens" page and get the token identifier for admin (for example U:admin;4c31a8d19b95a7dfe85c)

start server
```
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001 
```


#### Point of Sale
Install your first point of sale
```
python3 setup.py install <POS_IP>
```
After that, we must write our first admin RFID card. 
Login to the first POS, go to /home/{PI_USERNAME}/MAAPS/client/. 
Use the token you got from the token admin page
```
python3 hardware.py write "YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN_HERE" 
```
After your first card was created, you can login on the POS with this card and create additional cards.
